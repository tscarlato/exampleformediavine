This is a example node.js project in support of a job application.  The software is designed to run on a raspberry pi and operate an electronic door latch.

This project is currently being worked on in a private repository and is a small piece of a larger project. This is only an example of code I've written in node.js and shouldn't be considered a final or complete project.
